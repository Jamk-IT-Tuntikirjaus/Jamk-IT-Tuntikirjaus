Enhances [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin)
functionality with different deployment options for your scripts including:
- [`async`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#Attributes) attribute;
- [`defer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#Attributes) attribute;
- [`type="module"`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script#Attributes) attribute;
- inlining

This is an extension plugin for the [webpack](http://webpack.github.io) plugin [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin) - a plugin that simplifies the creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles.

The raw [html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin) incorporates all webpack-generated javascipt as synchronous`<script>` elements in the generated html.  This plugin allows you to add attributes to these elements or even to inline the code in the element.

Installation
------------
You must be running webpack on node 4+.

Install the plugin with npm:
```shell
$ npm install --save-dev script-ext-html-webpack-plugin
```

You may see an `UNMET PEER DEPENDENCY` warning for webpack.

This is fine; in testing, we dynamically download multiple versions of webpack (via the [dynavers](https://github.com/numical/dynavers) module).


Basic Usage
-----------
Add the plugin to your webpack config as follows: 

```javascript
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
  new ScriptExtHtmlWebpackPlugin()
]  
```
The above configuration will actually do nothing due to the configuration defaults. Some more useful scenarios:

All scripts set to `async`:
```javascript
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
  new ScriptExtHtmlWebpackPlugin({
    defaultAttribute: 'async'
  })
]  
```

All scripts set to `async` except 'first.js' which is sync:
```javascript
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
  new ScriptExtHtmlWebpackPlugin({
    sync: ['first.js'],
    defaultAttribute: 'async'
  })
]  
```

Configuration offers much more complex options:

Configuration
-------------
You must pass a hash of configuration options to the plugin to cause the addition of attributes:
- `inline`: array of `String`'s and/or `RegExp`'s defining scripts that should be inlined in the html (default: `[]`);
- `sync`: array of `String`'s and/or `RegExp`'s defining script names that should have no attribute (default: `[]`);
- `async`: array of `String`'s and/or `RegExp`'s defining script names that should have an `async` attribute (default: `[]`);
- `defer`: array of `String`'s and/or `RegExp`'s defining script names that should have a `defer` attribute (default: `[]`);
- `defaultAttribute`: `'sync' | 'async' | 'defer'` The default attribute to set - `'sync'` actually results in no attribute (default: `'sync'`);
- `module`: array of `String`'s and/or `RegExp`'s defining script names that should have a
`type="module"` attribute (default: `[]`).

In the arrays a `String` value matches if it is a substring of the script name.

In more complicated use cases it may prove difficult to ensure that the pattern matching for different attributes are mutually exclusive.  To prevent confusion, the plugin operates a simple precedence model:

1. if a script name matches a `RegEx` or `String` from the `inline` option, it will be inlined;

2. if a script name matches a `Regex` or `String` from the `sync` option, it will have no attribute, *unless* it matched condition 1;

3. if a script name matches a `Regex` or `String` from the `async` option, it will have the `async` attribute, *unless* it matched conditions 1 or 2;

4. if a script name matches a `Regex` or `String` from the `defer` option, it will have the `defer` attribute, *unless* it matched conditions 1, 2 or 3;

5. if a script name does not match any of the previous conditions, it will have the `defaultAttribute' attribute.

The `module` attribute is independent of conditions 2-5, but will be ignored if the script isinlined.

Some Examples:

All scripts with 'important' in their name are sync and all others set to `defer`:
```javascript
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
  new ScriptExtHtmlWebpackPlugin({
    sync: ['important'],
    defaultAttribute: 'defer'
  })
]  
```

Alternatively, using a regular expression:
```javascript
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
  new ScriptExtHtmlWebpackPlugin({
    sync: [/important/],
    defaultAttribute: 'defer'
  })
]  
```

All scripts with 'mod' in their name are async and type 'module', all others are sync (no explicit setting for this as it is the default):
```javascript
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
  new ScriptExtHtmlWebpackPlugin({
    async: ['mod'],
    module: ['mod']
  })
]  
```

Script 'startup.js' is inlined whilst all other scripts are async:
```javascript
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
  new ScriptExtHtmlWebpackPlugin({
    inline: ['startup'],
    defaultAttribute: 'async'
  })
]  
```

And so on, to craziness:
```javascript
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
  new ScriptExtHtmlWebpackPlugin({
    inline: ['startup'],  
    sync: [/imp(1|2){1,3}}/, 'initial'],
    defer: ['slow', /big.*andslow/],
    module: [/^((?!sync).)*/, 'mod']
    defaultAttribute: 'async'
  })
]  
```

Any problems with real-world examples, just raise an issue.  


A Note on Script Names
----------------------
In the above examples the actual script names are used to select the deployment option.  You may not wish to couple asset names to your deployment like this.  Instead you can use [Webpack's entry configuration](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/#object-syntax) to create aliases that the plugin will then use for its pattern matching. Your `webpack.config.js` will look something like this:
```javascript
entry: {
  a: path.join(__dirname, 'lib/myFunctions.js'),
  b: path.join(__dirname, 'lib/otherFunctions.js'),
  c: path.join(__dirname, 'lib/criticalFuntions.js')
},
output: {
  ...
  filename: '[name].js'
}
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin(),
  new ScriptExtHtmlWebpackPlugin({
    inline: ['c'],  
    defer: ['a', 'b']
  })
]  
```


Inlining
--------
Several notes and caveats apply:
* This feature is for `<script>`'s only. If you wish to inline css please see the sister plugin
[style-ext-html-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/numical/style-ext-html-webpack-plugin).
* Even the simplest script will be wrapped with webpack boilerplate; ensure you minify your javascript if you want your output html to be legible!
* Hot replacement of inlined scripts will only work if caching is [switched off](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin#configuration) for html-webpack-plugin:
```javascript
plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      cache: false
    }),
    new ScriptExtHtmlWebpackPlugin({
      inline: ['myinlinedscript.js']
    })
]
```
* An alternative approach, based on jade templates is illustrated in the [HtmlWebpackPlugin inline example](https://github.com/ampedandwired/html-webpack-plugin/tree/master/examples/inline).
